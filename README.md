# DC4Ever

This was my second dc emulator, after toying with dcemu for a few months and abandoning VB6 as a platform.

It is here only for archival reasons.

I have recovered the history from several backups, trying to get the latest verison of the source here.

The code likely doesn't compile as is.

nullDC was partially derived from this, after joining forces with David. A few things, like the interpreter, are somehow still alive and strong in Reicast, 15 years later!


Cheers,
