bios is Emulated using full emulation mode (no bios)
or mixed emulated mode (some hle and direct bios calls)

hle calls are interpreted using "fake" opcodes
here is the list of fake opcodes:
(Notice when running in nobios the hle table is used too)
nobios:
All font calls
All flash calls
hle:
All gdrom calls
65537:return from call,direct

Curently all this is just history ;D
